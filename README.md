Line Chart
==========

This small library allows you to plot a graph in a line chart visualization
that can be displayed on a modern browser.
All you need to do is prepare your data in the form of
Javascript array containing several [xi, yi] in this format:
[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ... , [xn, yn]].
See the example.html file on how to use it.
